The MRI images (with and without tumor) are for teaching purposes prepared from the below source data. They are already sorted in two directories for our two classes to classify/predict.

The ownership of the data is: "Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection" https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection Navoneel Chakrabarty (2019), version 1.0.

For this project, we converted the original images into grayscale png images.

The loaded data contains two folders with grayscale MRI brain images in png format

Folder "yes" contains images with tumors
Folder "no" contains images without tumors
Folder "benchmark" contains independent test images
Note: Ideally, the input images are all of the same pixel width and height. This way, we profit from the best resolution available from this data.
